A more typical month, distance-wise.

A total of 1811km which included a trip to my sister's place in the Southern Highlands and a trip to Sydney. Actually managed to have a stress free 600km round trip charge-wise. Figured out how to charge at my mother's place without tripping the RCDs. For the return trip we stopped at the ChargeFox station in Zetland and didn't have to wait for anyone else using the fast charging station. The 700m drop in elevation between Robertson and Wollongong meant that leg of the trip averaged 9.4 kWh/100km - well below the average of 16 I was getting between Sydney and Newcastle.

Confirmed that rain makes a huge difference. The second trip home between Sydney and Newcastle had steady rain (nothing like the storm the previous month), but doing a steady 110km/h in the rain uses 19.5 kWh/100km.

The warmer weather improves efficiency. I've gone from around 15.5 during winter to around 14 in spring. There was a week where I didn't need to use heating or cooling and the dash was displaying 11. I expect it to go up again as we head into summer and need to use the air conditioner.

One of the things that I keep seeing on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nissanleaf/">r/nissanleaf</a> is an obsession with the LeafSpy SOH (State of Health) value. I've been running LeafSpy regularly and I'm not sure I've spotted a pattern yet. The SOH dip in the charts actually precedes the long trip South.
