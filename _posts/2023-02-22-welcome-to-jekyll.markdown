WordPress is overkill for what I'm doing here.

And I'm sick of all the spam comments and access attempts that I ignore anyway.

So I've converted it to a static website using [Jekyll][jekyll-docs]. Then I can just create blog pages using [Markdown][markdown] in VS Code, push it up to my Github repository and pull it down to my hosting provider.
