# Still Waiting

So the dealer emailed me last week saying the delivery detail and window tinting have been done but BMW have issued a stop delivery due to a recall notice.

When I checked the VIN on <https://www.recall.bmw.com.au/> last week the "Updating HU Apps" one was there but another one has been added since then. That one sounds a bit more serious.

| Defect Code | Recall Number | Description	|
|----|----|----|
| 0065680400 | N/A | Updating HU Apps |
| 0034780200 | N/A | Integrated braking system (customer information part III) |
