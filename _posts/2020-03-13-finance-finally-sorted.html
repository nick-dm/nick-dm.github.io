<p class="">Oh Bank Australia. I really appreciate your corporate values, but you made it so hard to stick with you.<br />
Almost a month between applying for a loan and the dealer being sent the payment stretched my patience. It is as though every little interaction sent my application to the end of a queue. If it wasnâ€™t for the very low interest rate and no fees when borrowing for a low-emissions vehicle, I would have gone somewhere else.<br />
But we finally made it through and I pick up the car on Tuesday.<br />
This weekend I get to clean out the Renegade of all my stuff and have it ready to trade-in.</p>
