<p>Time for a summary of my ownership for the end of financial year 2019-2020.</p>
<p class="">In the 3.5 months I've had the Leaf I've driven 3894 km at an average, if the trip computer is to be believed, of 15.6 kWh/100km (2420 mi @ 4 mi/kWh). This has been around a 70/30 mix of city and highway driving.</p>
<p class="">So how does this compare to my last vehicle, a Jeep Renegade?</p>

<p class="">The surprising thing here is that, while I've halved* the fuel cost I've only reduced my CO2 emissions by around 14% according to the information on my electricity bill.</p>
<p>* This assumes I've done all of my charging at home. In reality, I've done about 25% of my charging on free, public chargers. And they claim to use greener sources of power that Origin do. So if I say that about 450 kWh of charging was done at home, that reduces my cost to $140 and 414 kg CO2.</p>
<p class="">I bought a smart plug for my charger and it logs how much energy is used, so I'll have a better idea on how much charging I do at home and exactly how much it is costing me. Also, I'm currently on the list to change to Amber Electric <a href="https://www.amberelectric.com.au/">https://www.amberelectric.com.au/</a> which should reduce both the cost per kWh and CO2 emissions. Amber use real-time wholesale pricing, so I should be able to schedule charging the car through the smart plug when their prices are cheapest.</p>
