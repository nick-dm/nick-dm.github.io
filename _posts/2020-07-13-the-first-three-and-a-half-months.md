Time for a summary of my ownership for the end of financial year 2019-2020.

In the 3.5 months I've had the Leaf I've driven 3894 km at an average, if the trip computer is to be believed, of 15.6 kWh/100km (2420 mi @ 4 mi/kWh). This has been around a 70/30 mix of city and highway driving.

So how does this compare to my last vehicle, a Jeep Renegade?

|     | Nissan Leaf ZE1 | Jeep Renegade Sport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consumption | 15.6 kWh/100km | 7.25 l/100km (32 mpg) |
| Total for 3894km | 607 kWh | 282 l |
| Unit cost | $0.31372/kWh | $1.349/l |
| Total cost | $190 | $380 |
| Emissions | 0.92 kg/kWh | 2.3 kg/l |
| Total CO2 | 559kg | 649kg |

The surprising thing here is that, while I've halved* the fuel cost I've only reduced my CO2 emissions by around 14% according to the information on my electricity bill.

This assumes I've done all of my charging at home. In reality, I've done about 25% of my charging on free, public chargers. And they claim to use greener sources of power that Origin do. So if I say that about 450 kWh of charging was done at home, that reduces my cost to $140 and 414 kg CO2.

I bought a smart plug for my charger and it logs how much energy is used, so I'll have a better idea on how much charging I do at home and exactly how much it is costing me. Also, I'm currently on the list to change to [Amber Electric][amber] which should reduce both the cost per kWh and CO2 emissions. Amber use real-time wholesale pricing, so I should be able to schedule charging the car through the smart plug when their prices are cheapest.
