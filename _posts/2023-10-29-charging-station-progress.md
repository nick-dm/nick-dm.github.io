How has EV charging availability progressed in Sydney since I bought the Leaf?

I keep meaning to revisit [Where are the chargers in south-western Sydney?]({% post_url 2020-03-14-where-are-the-chargers-in-south-western-sydney %}) to see how far charging infrastructure has increased in Sydney over the past 3-and-a-half years.

I'm a bit surprised that the number of AC chargers haven't increased more outside of the eastern and inner-western suburbs.

Changing CHAdeMO to CCS2 adds a few more, mainly along the major highways.

But what the hell is going on with the A9 between Penrith and Campbelltown. There are zero chargers on that stretch of road.
