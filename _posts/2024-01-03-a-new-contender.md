So while waiting for my job probation period to end an new contender leapt to the top of my list. The Skoda Enyaq.

One thing that has bothered me about the iX1 was the range. While everything else about the car sort of justified the price, the size of the battery could be better.
The Skoda with a WLTP range of 565 km from an 88 kWh (77 kWh usable) is much better than the iX1's 439 km from 66.5 kWh (64.7 kWh usable) and will probably be a bit cheaper.
Another advantage of the Enyaq is the 585 l boot volume vs 490 l for the iX1.

Just need to wait until, hopefully, April when they start taking orders for delivery in the second half of the year.
