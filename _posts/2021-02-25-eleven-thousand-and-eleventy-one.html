<p>Yes, it has been a while since the last post and not a lot has happened.</p>

<p>In December, I had booked the car in for it's 10,000 km service. When I went to drop it off the guy at the service centre said that the service interval for the Leaf is 12 months or 20,000 km. There's nothing in the log books that spell that out, the service centre where I bought the car had put 6 months/10,000km on the window sticker and the service reminder on the dash is set to remind you at 10,000 km. But, sure enough, when I checked the fixed price schedule on the Nissan website, it has 12/20,000. Anyway, someone at a car dealership actually saved me some money, so I'm not complaining :).</p>

<p>After finally getting used to planning and having enough charge to get to where I need to go I forgot to charge the car before we needed to head to Sydney. I wasn't too worried until I found that 2 of the 3 fast chargers in Newcastle were out-of-order and the good one had a Tesla plugged in each time I tried to use it (3 attempts over 2 days). Luckily (sort of), I got called to do some work due to the snap Victorian lockdown so I got to charge the car at home overnight and had a fully charged battery for the trip.</p>

<p>Paid for charging for the first time on a commercial fast charger. The Evie Networks charger at Seven Hills is in a good spot. Although at 60c/kWh it's quite expensive. It took 43 minutes to add 24.751 kWh and cost $14.85 (from 27% to 86% according to LeafSpy)</p>

<p>I've got a trip to Coffs Harbour planned soon which will need a at least 2 charge stops to get there. ChargeFox and Evie both have charging infrastructure on the Pacific Highway so it shouldn't be a problem. But I'm interested to see if the second charge is much slower than the first.</p>
