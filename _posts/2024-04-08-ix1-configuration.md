Since January the two leading options I was favouring were the Skoda Enyaq and the Audi Q4 e-tron.

And then I read this: <https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/2025-skoda-enyaq-here-in-october-with-gfv-drive-away-pricing>. Arriving here in October and only the coupe version.

There's been no more information on the Q4 or even the ID.4. I have no idea what the Volkswagen Australia Group are doing.

I feel like I've wasted the last few months thinking I something better was coming. So I'm going back to my original choice.

Today I contacted my employer's salary packaging provider to lease a BMW iX1.

I would like to get the xDrive30 with the Enhancement Package (with the glass roof and massaging seats) but only if it comes in under the Luxury Car Tax threshold. I'll contact Newcastle BMW again so see if they can do better than the leasing company's buyers.
