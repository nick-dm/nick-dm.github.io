<p>The first of two posts that explain my time away from the IT industry.</p>
<h2>Why I decided to become a teacher.</h2>
<p>The reason I became a teacher is a lot more complicated than the reason I left teaching.</p>
<p>The seed had been planted by a casual conversation at an IT conference dinner. I was asked, "What would you do if you weren't working in IT?" After a surprisingly short amount of deliberation my reply was "I'd probably be a maths teacher."</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the Applied Maths course that I did as part of my Science degree and for a while I had looked for programmingÂ jobs that had a mathematical analysis focus but was never successful. Somehow, I ended up following a middleware administration path and became very good at it (if I do say so myself) over 10 or so years. And every now and then, usually when a contract ended or something happened with the extended family, I asked myself if there was something different or better that I could be doing with my professional life.</p>
<p>A combination of factors was making me feel dissatisfied with work. I didn't have to try too hard to do a good job, wasn't learning anything new, working in an industry very focussed on the bottom line, working in Sydney and only spending weekends at home in Newcastle. Looking at this list, I'm not sure I'm actually fixing any of this by taking the job I'm leaving teaching to do.</p>
